# SkillCraft-Technology-Internship-Projects
This repository showcases various machine learning projects, including House Price Prediction, Customer Segmentation, Dog vs Cat Image Classification, and Hand Gesture Recognition. Each project demonstrates practical implementations of ML algorithms and their real-world applications in supervised and unsupervised learning.
#Projects Included:
1. House Price Prediction
Predicts house prices based on features like square footage, bedrooms, and bathrooms using Linear Regression.

2. Customer Segmentation
Groups retail customers based on purchase history using K-means clustering.

3. Dog vs Cat Image Classification
Classifies images of dogs and cats using SVM.

4. Hand Gesture Recognition
Recognizes different hand gestures from image data using machine learning techniques.

#Usage:
Each project folder contains a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) file that demonstrates the model implementation.
Example data for each project is included, or links to datasets are provided.

#Requirements:
Python 3.x
Libraries: NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, TensorFlow/Keras (for CNN projects), etc.
